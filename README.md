Bricks Game
============================

Bricks Game is a clone of [Miniclip’s Ores game](https://www.miniclip.com/games/ores/en/) I wrote a few years ago for fun, just to learn something new.
It is written in C++, uses [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/) to handle graphics, sound and IO, and has a very simple implementation of a game engine based on the concepts used on [Andengine](http://www.andengine.org/).
Unfortunately at time I wrote this I was using windows+Code::Blocks IDE, and didn’t have the time yet make it cross-platform and write a Makefile to make it easier to compile and run.
